### Session 1: 
-	Introduction to the club + Cursor
-	Ice Breaker games, getting to know each other (at least everyone’s name) 
-	Knowing the general course for the semester
-	Skills students should be able to obtain if everything goes well + expectations for the students
-	Install Cursor & sign up/log in if there’s time left (if not, HW) 

To create a welcoming environment for everyone, to freely express themselves. 
To inform the students about what it means to be in this club, both fun and hardship

### Session 2: 
-	Check everyone has Cursor now
-	Start-up, and know the basic functions of Cursor
-	Start brainstorming about a website the students would like to make (it should be unique for each student), but ideas are welcomed to be discussed
-	Final decision and starts to actually try out Cursor to create a project (if there’s no time, HW) 

Get everyone ready to start creating their own website and use their imagination and creativity as much as they want during creation process. 

### Session 3: 
-	Everyone starts to make the actual website (if not already started), and try to be close to finish of at least at the end of class
-	They can discuss with each other about ideas, and difficulties, and everyone helps each other in the progress. Deepening their understanding of Cursor, programming, caring, and collaborating. 

Let the students gets involved in the process of exploring the functions of Cursor, communicate with each other, help, collaborate, and finish a little project. (or at least tried to)

### Session 4: 
-	Now talk about some functions specific to making games if not already discussed. If already discussed a bit, then it will mostly be a review. 
-	Brainstorm and decide on a theme of their game, its best to stay simple if they want it to finish, but all students would be encouraged to go for a higher standard. 

Moving on to games, and guide them to always do their best, face challenges, and adjust to a tight schedule if the students are really engaged and wants to finish each project off with a perfect note. 

### Session 5: 
-	Starts to think about the game structure, its plot, the beginning and ending, and even the characters if there’s any. 
-	Start to lay out a base of the entire game, and fix it little by little while focusing on the details. 
-	Start to go into detail of the whole planning. 

Train the students to plan and try and see what’s going to happen (get direct and timely response). Exercise their skills and will at implementing their planning. Prep the students for future projects with more challenging demands. 

### Session 6: 
-	Continue on developing the game, and polish the details. Students will discuss with each other and provide feedbacks or suggestions to each other. 
-	Laughing at each other or making jokes of one’s project would be forbidden. 
-	There’s no need to rush a lot, but students would be encouraged to has around 75% of their game done. 

Allow the students to have more time to further improve with their games, and push them to work at a high efficiency, accomplishing small goals to accomplish a bigger goal as a whole. 

### Session 7: 
-	Students would try to finish of their game and do final testing, and polishing, and fix any bugs left. 
-	They can discuss with each other and give comments. 
-	Students are allowed to show their game to the whole class if they wish and there’s time, it is not compulsory, but students would be encouraged to do so. 
-	Students not finished with their game are to finish it in their spare time. Others can try to (and encouraged to) develop similar projects on their own, find help willingly, and exercise their skills even further. 

Give the students time to finish off strong, and display a well-done work. They would be encouraged to display themselves willingly, not forced. 
They would be more exposed to the progress of doing a project from start to end, and be more confident to showing their works to others. 

### Session 8: 
-	Start with the creation of software (not compulsory to finish in this semester, but are strong suggested to go for that)
-	Getting to know the difficulties they may face in the progress
-	Brainstorm the kind of app they may want to create, students may get into groups of 2 to 3 to do this project, but they ca also do it independently if they insist. 
-	Students may look at existing apps during brainstorming, but are not allowed to directly “copy-paste” an app’s idea/theme with little or no changes (like bad paraphrasing in Ind&Soc). 
-	Students can start brainstorming and writing down the actual functions of their app, and anything other ideas they have. It is strong recommended for groups to gather and discuss with each other about this outside of the club too. 

Officially moving on to the hardest project of the semester in this club, an actual functioning app. Students would be facing the more hardships and challenges than ever before in this club, and all their skills and knowledge in the field will be challenged harshly. And students would need to use their skills with care, also because their time is constrained. 

### Session 9: 
-	Students will get into their groups and discuss their own plans for the software. 
-	Students would have to consider the software’s future application field after they finished
-	Begin to make the software
-	Collaborate with group members and divide up the work
-	It is strong suggested to meet up outside of club time too and discuss the details about the app, to make sure everyone is approximately on the right track. 

This can further test the students’ collaboration skills and self-discipline. Groups members would be expected to watch out for each other, and also complete their own part on time, so the whole group can move on. 

### Session 10-11: 
-	The process of last week’s club will continue on, and everyone should try their best to do as much as they can with the best possible quality. 
-	If there’s possibilities of actually finishing, go for it. 

Give more time for them to finish and discuss and develop. 

### Session 12: 
-	Half of the class will still be given to them to continue with their software
-	Last half of the class will be committed to a “gallery” where everyone gets to see each other’s work. The website and the game are expected to be definitely finished by now, and software that are finished will also be shown to everyone. 

Let everyone see the progress they’ve made this semester, and comment on each other’s work. It is hoped that every student has had a wonderful experience in this club.
