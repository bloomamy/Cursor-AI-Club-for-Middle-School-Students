# Cursor AI Club for Middle School Students
# 给初中生的Cursor AI俱乐部
#### By Amy

Do you want to create your own game? Or would you like to have your very own website? Cursor is a newly developed AI tool that can help you with this. The entire club will explore the functions of Cursor, its various application prospects, and develop your own little digital world. This is not just learning, but can also be seen as a new daily pleasure. At the end of the semester, every student would be expected to have a unique project completed over half of the process with the help of Cursor. The project could be a game, website, or even a fully functional software. We hope this would be a special and unique experience to all participants (or at least help with your Computer Science class :P)

你想创建自己的游戏吗？或者拥有自己的网站？Cursor是一个可以对此帮助你的近期被开发出的人工智能工具。整个俱乐部将一起探讨Cursor的功能，它的各种应用前景，并开发出自己的一小片数字天地。这不仅是学习，同时也可以被看作是一种新的日常乐趣。在学期末，我们期望学生们能各个拥有一个独特的项目，并以通过Cursor完成超过一半的进程。这个项目可以是游戏，网站，甚至一个功能齐全的软件。我们希望这对所有参与者来说都是一次独特且特殊的经历（或至少对你的计算机科学课有所帮助 :P）
